Comprehensive List of Potential Analysis Functions for the MCP Server

Below is a detailed list of analysis functions divided into two categories: those utilizing Sentinel satellite data (35 examples) and those utilizing other satellite resources (35 examples). Each function includes a title and a brief description.

Sentinel Satellite Data-Based Functions (35 Examples)
	1.	Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) – Calculates vegetation greenness using Sentinel-2’s red and near-infrared bands. NDVI values (–1 to +1) indicate plant health, and it is one of the most widely used indices in remote sensing for monitoring crop and forest vigor ￼.
	2.	Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) – Highlights water bodies or vegetation water content using Sentinel-2 bands (often green and near-infrared or shortwave infrared). High NDWI values make open water stand out against soil and vegetation ￼, aiding in mapping wetlands and surface water changes (e.g., drought impacts).
	3.	Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) – Detects snow and ice cover using Sentinel-2’s green and shortwave-infrared bands. NDSI delineates snow/ice presence by exploiting their unique reflectance, and it’s commonly used for mapping snow extent for hydrological forecasting ￼.
	4.	Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) – Uses Sentinel-2’s shortwave-infrared and near-infrared bands to emphasize urban areas. Positive NDBI values indicate built-up land (concrete, asphalt), making it a vital tool for mapping city extents and monitoring urban growth ￼.
	5.	Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) – Measures vegetation moisture content by combining Sentinel-2 near-infrared and shortwave-infrared reflectance. NDMI helps detect plant water stress and soil moisture levels ￼, useful in drought monitoring and irrigation management.
	6.	Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) – Highlights burn scars from wildfires using Sentinel-2’s near-infrared and shortwave-infrared bands. NBR produces high values for healthy vegetation and very low values for burned areas, thus identifying fire-affected zones ￼ and aiding post-fire damage assessments.
	7.	Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) – An alternative vegetation index from Sentinel-2 that adjusts for atmospheric effects and soil background. EVI is more sensitive in high-biomass areas than NDVI ￼, making it useful for dense tropical forests or crop monitoring where NDVI saturates.
	8.	Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) – A vegetation index designed for sparse vegetation areas, calculated from Sentinel-2 bands with a soil-brightness correction factor. SAVI minimizes soil reflectance influence on NDVI ￼, improving vegetation signal detection in semi-arid regions or rangelands.
	9.	Modified SAVI (MSAVI) – An improvement over SAVI that further reduces bare soil effects. MSAVI is computed from Sentinel-2 data to enhance vegetation signals where vegetation cover is low ￼, providing more reliable estimates of vegetation in sparsely covered lands.
	10.	Red-Edge Vegetation Index (NDRE) – Utilizes Sentinel-2’s red-edge band and NIR band to assess plant chlorophyll content. NDRE is effective at detecting crop stress and nutrient status in later growth stages when NDVI becomes less responsive ￼ ￼, hence widely used in precision agriculture for mid-to-late season crop monitoring.
	11.	Land Cover Classification (Supervised) – Produces thematic maps (forest, water, urban, etc.) from Sentinel-2 imagery by training on known samples. Sentinel-2’s 10–20 m resolution and multi-spectral bands allow detailed land use/land cover mapping, an essential application noted as a key use of Sentinel-2 data ￼ (covering crops, forests, urban areas, water resources, etc.).
	12.	Unsupervised Classification (Clustering) – Automatically clusters Sentinel imagery into land cover categories without prior training data (e.g. k-means clustering). This function groups pixels into spectrally similar classes, which is useful for initial mapping in unknown regions and can reveal patterns for further analysis.
	13.	Change Detection (Multi-temporal) – Identifies land cover change between different dates of Sentinel images. By comparing imagery over time, it pinpoints changes such as deforestation, urban expansion, or disaster impacts. Change detection is widely used across disciplines (environmental monitoring, urban planning, forestry, etc.) to quantify where and when changes occur ￼.
	14.	Time-Series Trend Analysis (Phenology) – Analyzes sequences of Sentinel-2 images (or derived NDVI/EVI time series) to extract trends and seasonal patterns. This function can determine phenological metrics like start of growing season, peak greenness, or long-term vegetation trends, helping in climate change studies and ecosystem monitoring ￼ (e.g., detecting delayed spring green-up or progressive vegetation “browning”).
	15.	Forest Cover & Deforestation Monitoring – Uses Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (radar) data to map forest extent and detect forest loss. Frequent satellite observations enable near-real-time identification of deforestation or logging activities. For instance, Sentinel-based studies have mapped forest disturbance (clear-cuts) and even specific forest types, proving more effective than lower resolution data for monitoring forest extent and change ￼.
	16.	Crop Health Monitoring & Yield Estimation – Leverages Sentinel-2 NDVI/EVI imagery to assess crop conditions throughout the growing season. Healthy crops show high NDVI; stressed crops show lower values. This function can detect areas of pest damage, nutrient deficiency, or drought stress early ￼ and helps estimate crop yields by relating vegetation indices to biomass or expected output.
	17.	Flood Inundation Mapping (SAR) – Employs Sentinel-1’s all-weather radar to delineate flooded areas, even under cloud cover. Radar backscatter drops dramatically over water, allowing automated flood extent mapping ￼. This is crucial for disaster response, as SAR-based flood maps can be generated in near real-time to identify affected regions regardless of darkness or clouds.
	18.	Urban Expansion Monitoring – Tracks the growth of built-up areas using multi-date Sentinel-2 images. By comparing classifications or indices like NDBI over time, this function highlights where cities are expanding. Sentinel-2’s free high-resolution data has a positive impact on urban monitoring ￼, enabling city planners and researchers to quantify sprawl, new developments, or the loss of peri-urban green spaces.
	19.	Wetland Mapping – Integrates Sentinel-2 optical and Sentinel-1 SAR data to identify wetlands and monitor their extent. Wetlands have distinct spectral/Radar signatures (often high NDWI and unique backscatter). Multi-sensor approaches using Sentinel improve detection of waterlogged terrain and vegetation ￼, supporting conservation of these ecologically important areas.
	20.	Soil Moisture Estimation (Active SAR) – Utilizes Sentinel-1 radar backscatter sensitivity to soil moisture. Changes in Sentinel-1’s dual-polarization signals (VV/VH) can be related to surface wetness, providing maps of near-surface soil moisture at field scales. Such SAR-based soil moisture mapping has been used in agriculture and drought studies, complementing optical drought indices ￼.
	21.	Leaf Area Index (LAI) Retrieval – Derives LAI (leaf area per ground area) from Sentinel-2 reflectance or vegetation indices. LAI is a key plant parameter linked to biomass and canopy coverage. Sentinel-2’s red-edge bands and high resolution enable more accurate LAI mapping ￼, used in forestry and crop modeling to quantify productivity or canopy health.
	22.	Forest Disturbance Detection (SAR Coherence) – Uses repeat-pass Sentinel-1 radar to detect forest disturbances like logging via coherence changes. When trees are removed, the radar signal consistency between passes drops. Sentinel-1 applications include clear-cut and partial-cut detection, forest type classification, biomass estimation, and disturbance mapping ￼. This function provides rapid alerts of forest cover change, even under clouds or at night.
	23.	Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Generation (InSAR) – Creates elevation models by processing Sentinel-1 Interferometric SAR data. Pairs of SAR images are used to derive terrain heights (akin to what the SRTM mission achieved). Although global DEMs exist, this function can produce up-to-date local DEMs or capture topographic changes (e.g., due to landslides or volcanic swelling) by measuring phase differences between Sentinel-1 acquisitions.
	24.	Land Subsidence & Uplift Monitoring (InSAR) – Detects ground deformation by comparing the phase of Sentinel-1 radar images over time. InSAR time-series can measure subsidence from groundwater withdrawal or mining, and uplift from tectonics or volcanism with millimeter accuracy. Indeed, InSAR has been widely used to detect land deformation (e.g., due to fluctuating groundwater levels) ￼, making it invaluable for urban infrastructure safety and geological hazard monitoring.
	25.	Sea Ice Mapping (Cryosphere) – Utilizes Sentinel-1 SAR imagery to map sea ice extent and type in polar regions. Radar can discriminate ice vs open water and is not impeded by polar night or clouds. High-resolution ice charts from Sentinel-1 support navigation and climate research, with dual-polarization data significantly improving ice classification ￼. This function helps monitor Arctic sea ice decline and seasonal dynamics.
	26.	Ship Detection (Maritime Surveillance) – Detects vessels at sea using Sentinel-1 radar images. Ships appear as bright spots in SAR imagery, enabling identification of shipping traffic or illegal vessels. Sentinel-1’s non-cooperative ship detection can find vessels without AIS trackers (e.g., smugglers or illegal fishing boats) ￼. Automated ship detection aids maritime security and traffic monitoring in all weather, day or night.
	27.	Oil Spill Detection – Identifies oil slicks on water using Sentinel-1 SAR, as oil dampens capillary waves and appears as dark patches on radar images. This function is used to monitor marine oil spills or illegal bilge dumping ￼. Correlating detected slicks with known ship positions (AIS) can help pinpoint polluters. It’s a vital environmental tool, as demonstrated by detection of spills after vessel collisions.
	28.	Ocean Color & Water Quality (Sentinel-3) – Leverages Sentinel-3’s OLCI sensor (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) to measure chlorophyll and other ocean color indices. This function maps algal bloom extents, ocean phytoplankton concentrations, and coastal water turbidity. Sentinel-3’s mission is dedicated to oceanography ￼, so it provides routine monitoring of ocean productivity, eutrophication in lakes, and marine health indicators like red-tide events.
	29.	Atmospheric Air Quality Mapping (Sentinel-5P) – Uses the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI instrument to map pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide. It provides daily global coverage of trace gases, revealing pollution hotspots over cities and power plants ￼. For example, Sentinel-5P NO₂ maps have been used to assess urban air quality and even the atmospheric changes during COVID-19 lockdowns.
	30.	Glacier and Ice Cap Monitoring – Maps the extent of glaciers and icefields using Sentinel-2’s visible/NIR bands (and snow indices) to track changes in glacial area and snow cover. The 10 m detail of Sentinel-2 allows accurate delineation of glacier boundaries ￼ and comparison year-to-year to quantify retreat due to warming. This function supports climate change studies by monitoring alpine glacier health and freshwater availability.
	31.	Polarimetric SAR Analysis – Exploits Sentinel-1’s dual-polarization (VV/VH) data to derive additional land information. For instance, the ratio of cross-polarized to co-polarized backscatter (VH/VV) is sensitive to vegetation structure and moisture ￼. Such polarimetric indices help differentiate crop types, assess forest biomass, or even detect wet soils, enhancing classification accuracy beyond single-pol data.
	32.	Multi-Sensor Data Fusion – Combines Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (and others) to improve analysis outcomes. For example, integrating radar and optical data can yield more accurate land cover classifications and change detection ￼. This function might merge Sentinel-2’s spectral detail with Sentinel-1’s all-weather capabilities, or use Sentinel-3 thermal data to augment Sentinel-2 analyses, providing a more robust view than any single sensor alone.
	33.	Bathymetric Mapping (Shallow Waters) – Estimates shallow water depths in clear coastal areas using Sentinel-2’s blue and green bands. By analyzing how light attenuates through water, this function can produce bathymetry maps for coral reefs, atolls, or coastal shelves. It is useful for marine habitat mapping and navigation safety in areas where LiDAR or sonar data are unavailable.
	34.	Active Wildfire Hotspot Detection – Identifies active fires using Sentinel-3’s SLSTR thermal infrared channels. Large fires will show up as high-temperature pixels. While Sentinel-3 provides a coarse resolution, it contributes to global fire monitoring systems (complementing MODIS/VIIRS). Detected hotspots alert authorities to new wildfires, even through smoke at night, supporting faster wildfire response.
	35.	Methane Emission Detection (TROPOMI) – Detects large methane plumes and “super-emitter” sources from Sentinel-5P’s TROPOMI data. With its high-precision methane measurements, Sentinel-5P can pinpoint significant CH₄ leaks from pipelines, gas wells, or landfills ￼. This function is transforming greenhouse gas monitoring by revealing emitters on a global scale, aiding climate mitigation efforts.

Other Satellite Data Analysis Functions (35 Examples)
	1.	Land Surface Temperature (Thermal) – Derives the Earth’s surface temperature from thermal infrared sensors (e.g., Landsat-8 TIRS or MODIS). LST is a key parameter for energy balance and hydrology studies and is used to monitor heat waves, vegetation stress, and urban heat islands ￼. For instance, higher LST in cities indicates the urban heat island effect, and sudden LST anomalies may flag wildfire events or volcanic activity ￼.
	2.	Active Fire Detection (Thermal Infrared) – Uses satellites like NASA’s MODIS and NOAA’s VIIRS to detect active fires and hotspots in near-real time. These sensors identify thermal anomalies (typically at 1 km or 375 m resolution) and are used in global fire alert systems (e.g., FIRMS). The MODIS/VIIRS fire products provide timely data on wildfire locations ￼, enabling wildfire monitoring and disaster response agencies to map fire spread even under smoke or darkness.
	3.	Nighttime Lights Analysis – Utilizes satellite observations of city lights at night (e.g., the VIIRS Day/Night Band) to monitor human activity. Nighttime light imagery is widely used to track urban growth, electrification, and economic activity, as well as to detect power outages after disasters ￼. This unique perspective has been used in studies ranging from estimating populations to assessing light pollution impacts on wildlife.
	4.	Satellite Precipitation Estimation – Leverages dedicated missions like the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and its successor GPM to measure rainfall from space. These satellites combine microwave radiometers and radars to provide near-global precipitation data, which is invaluable in regions with sparse rain gauges. TRMM/GPM precipitation datasets are regarded as a valuable resource in hydrology and climate research, especially for monitoring rainfall in data-poor areas ￼ (e.g., monsoon tracking, flood early warning).
	5.	High-Resolution Object Detection – Involves analyzing very high resolution optical imagery (sub-meter from satellites like WorldView, GeoEye, or PlanetScope) to automatically detect and map small features. Examples include identifying individual buildings and roads for urban mapping, vehicles or ships for security, and even trees or solar panels. Modern approaches often use deep learning on these images to extract objects, enabling up-to-date maps of infrastructure and assets in ways medium-resolution satellites cannot.
	6.	LiDAR Terrain and Canopy Mapping – Uses data from spaceborne LiDAR missions (e.g., NASA’s GEDI on the ISS or ICESat-2) to obtain precise elevation profiles of the Earth’s surface and vegetation. LiDAR returns measure ground elevation under forests and tree canopy heights. This function generates high-detail digital terrain models and forest canopy height maps, improving estimates of forest biomass and structure. (For example, GEDI data have been used to produce 3D forest structure information that is now routinely used by earth science communities for carbon stock assessments ￼.)
	7.	Post-Disaster Damage Assessment – Compares pre- and post-event imagery to identify areas of destruction from disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, or explosions. High-resolution optical images or SAR coherence maps (from missions like Sentinel-1 or RADARSAT) can reveal where buildings have collapsed or infrastructure is damaged. A notable example is the use of satellite SAR coherence loss to map the Beirut port explosion destruction ￼. This function helps responders target aid by quickly mapping impacted zones and estimating damage severity.
	8.	Hyperspectral Mineral Mapping – Employs hyperspectral imaging satellites (such as Hyperion, PRISMA, or EnMAP) to identify minerals and soil types based on detailed spectral signatures. Imaging spectroscopy can detect subtle differences in surface composition – for example, distinguishing clay minerals, iron oxides, or carbonate outcrops – which is extremely useful in geological mapping and mining exploration. These advanced methods of hyperspectral remote sensing are now used routinely for mineral mapping and even environmental hazard assessments ￼.
	9.	Long-Term Vegetation Trend Analysis – Uses decades-long satellite data records (e.g., AVHRR and MODIS NDVI time series since the 1980s) to analyze changes in vegetation productivity over large areas. By averaging and comparing NDVI over time, researchers can identify areas undergoing greening (increasing vegetation) or browning (decreasing vegetation) due to climate change or land use. NDVI is one of the most widely used indicators in remote sensing ￼, and its long-term record underpins studies of desertification, drought impacts, and global carbon cycle dynamics.
	10.	Drought Monitoring (Vegetation Health Index) – Integrates satellite vegetation indices and thermal data to monitor agricultural drought. One popular approach is the Vegetation Health Index (VHI), which combines NDVI (vegetation condition) and Land Surface Temperature (thermal stress). VHI has been widely used to characterize drought severity ￼ – values below certain thresholds indicate drought-stricken vegetation. This function enables early warning of crop drought and famine conditions by highlighting areas of unusual vegetation stress due to lack of rainfall.
	11.	Groundwater Storage Tracking (GRACE Gravimetry) – Utilizes data from the GRACE satellite mission (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) to monitor changes in Earth’s gravity field caused by mass redistribution, notably changes in groundwater. GRACE-based analyses can estimate groundwater depletion or recharge in large aquifers. These satellite gravity data have been widely used to estimate groundwater storage changes globally ￼, revealing trends such as declining aquifers in India, the Middle East, and California’s Central Valley in the absence of dense well measurements.
	12.	Sea Level Rise Monitoring (Altimetry) – Uses satellite radar altimeters (e.g., TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1/2/3, and Sentinel-6) to measure the height of the ocean surface with centimeter accuracy. This function tracks global mean sea level changes and regional sea level trends. Decades of altimetry show that sea level has been rising at an accelerated rate of over 3 mm/year in the satellite era ￼. Such measurements are fundamental for climate change assessments, providing direct evidence of ocean warming and ice melt contributions and informing coastal planning for rising seas.
	13.	Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Mapping – Retrieves ocean skin temperature from infrared satellite sensors (like NOAA’s AVHRR, MODIS on Aqua/Terra, or VIIRS). SST is a critical climate variable – it influences weather patterns and marine life. Continuous satellite SST records are widely used in climate research and forecasting ￼, for example to monitor El Niño/La Niña events (warm/cool anomalies in Pacific SST) that affect global weather. High-resolution blended SST products (satellite + in situ) allow detection of marine heatwaves, upwelling zones, and long-term warming of oceans.
	14.	Ocean Color & Algal Bloom Monitoring – Uses satellites equipped with ocean color sensors (e.g., SeaWiFS, MODIS Aqua, VIIRS, or Sentinel-3 OLCI) to measure chlorophyll-a concentration and water color, indicators of phytoplankton biomass. This function maps concentrations of algae in oceans and lakes, allowing identification of harmful algal blooms and tracking of seasonal plankton cycles. Ocean color data help assess ocean productivity and are used in fisheries management. For instance, high chlorophyll patches can signify rich fishing grounds, while sudden spikes may warn of toxic algal blooms that threaten water quality.
	15.	Coral Reef Monitoring – Analyzes high-resolution optical imagery (from satellites like Landsat or Planet) to monitor coral reef ecosystems. Satellite data can reveal changes in reef extent, coral bleaching events (by detecting whitening of reefs via changes in reflectance), and sedimentation or pollution impacts in reef areas. Reefs in clear, shallow waters can be mapped for live coral cover vs. algal or sand cover. This function supports marine conservation by providing large-scale, repeatable assessments of reef health in remote areas that are otherwise hard to survey frequently.
	16.	Global Soil Moisture Mapping (Passive Microwave) – Uses satellite radiometers (e.g., SMAP, SMOS, AMSR-E/AMSR2) to measure soil moisture in the top ~5 cm of soil on a near-daily basis. Microwave observations can detect moisture because water changes the emissivity of soil. SMAP, for example, provides the best global view of soil moisture to date and has potential to greatly aid agriculture by monitoring drought conditions ￼. This function yields coarse-resolution (10–50 km) soil moisture maps that are assimilated into weather models and used in crop yield forecasting and flood/drought monitoring.
	17.	Evapotranspiration Estimation (Energy Balance) – Computes land evapotranspiration (ET) by combining satellite observations with meteorological data. Methods like SEBAL or METRIC use thermal infrared images (for surface temperature) along with reflectance (for vegetation indices) to solve the energy balance and estimate how much water is being evaporated/transpired. Using Landsat or MODIS data, this function provides field-scale to regional ET maps, which are crucial for irrigation management, water resource allocation, and understanding ecosystem water use, especially in arid agricultural regions.
	18.	Crop Type Mapping & Yield Prediction – Uses multi-temporal satellite data (optical or radar) to classify different crop types in agricultural regions and monitor their growth. By analyzing unique seasonal NDVI profiles or SAR signatures, one can distinguish, for example, wheat vs. corn vs. rice fields. Once crop area is mapped, further analysis of vegetation condition allows yield estimation. Governments and organizations employ this to predict harvests and food supply. For instance, MODIS NDVI time-series are used to forecast yields by correlating vegetation health with historical crop outputs.
	19.	Image Pan-Sharpening (Data Fusion) – Enhances the spatial resolution of multispectral imagery by fusing it with a higher-resolution panchromatic image from the same satellite. For example, Landsat’s 15 m panchromatic band can sharpen its 30 m color bands, and WorldView commercial satellites provide 0.5 m pan to sharpen 2 m multispectral data. Pan-sharpening yields a high-detail color image, which is useful for finer interpretation (e.g., seeing small urban features in a multispectral image) and is a common preprocessing step in remote sensing analysis.
	20.	Terrain Analysis (DEM-Based) – Utilizes global Digital Elevation Models (like NASA’s SRTM or ASTER GDEM) to derive topographic features such as elevation, slope, aspect, and watershed boundaries. SRTM’s near-global dataset (30 m to 90 m resolution) provides a baseline for such analyses ￼. This function is used in geology (e.g., mapping faults and landforms), hydrology (modeling runoff and basin catchments), and ecology (understanding habitat distribution by slope/aspect). It also underpins ortho-rectification of imagery and line-of-sight analyses for telecom and planning.
	21.	Stereo 3D Modeling (Photogrammetry) – Generates 3D models and elevation data by exploiting stereo pairs of high-resolution optical satellite images (such as SPOT 6/7 or Pléiades). By taking two images of the same area from different angles, one can extract depth information through photogrammetry. This function can produce very high-resolution DEMs or even 3D building models in urban areas. It’s commonly used for city modeling, engineering (to assess terrain for construction), and anywhere up-to-date elevation information is needed beyond what older DEMs provide.
	22.	Landscape Fragmentation Metrics – Computes spatial metrics on land cover maps (often derived from classification) to quantify habitat fragmentation or urban sprawl. For example, using a land cover map from satellite imagery, this function can calculate number of patches, patch size distribution, edge density, and connectivity of forests or other habitats. These metrics help ecologists understand the impact of land use change on wildlife corridors and biodiversity (e.g., identifying how an elephant corridor is broken into smaller patches), and help urban planners quantify how fragmented urban green spaces have become.
	23.	Coastal Erosion and Shoreline Change – Monitors changes in coastlines by comparing historical and current satellite images of the same coastal areas. This function can detect beach erosion, delta growth or retreat, and wetland loss. By digitizing shorelines from images across years or decades (Landsat archive is particularly useful here), analysts can measure how far the coastline has moved landward or seaward. It’s vital for climate resilience, as it quantifies effects of sea-level rise, storms, and human interference (like damming or coastal development) on coastal environments.
	24.	Water Turbidity and Quality Mapping – Uses satellite reflectance in visible bands to infer water quality parameters in lakes, rivers, and coastal zones. High turbidity or sediment-laden water can be mapped using indices (like a normalized difference between red and green bands). Likewise, satellites can detect chlorophyll or colored dissolved organic matter in inland waters, indicating algal blooms or pollution. For example, Landsat and Sentinel-2 have been used to monitor lake water clarity and identify pollution events (such as sediment plumes from land runoff). This function supports freshwater management by providing consistent, spatially extensive water quality monitoring.
	25.	Aerosol Optical Depth (Air Quality) – Retrieves aerosol concentration in the atmosphere from sensors like MODIS or MISR. By measuring how much sunlight is scattered/absorbed, satellites estimate Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), which correlates with particulate matter pollution (haze, dust, smoke). This function generates maps of aerosol distribution, useful for air quality assessments and climate studies (since aerosols affect radiation and cloud formation). For example, MODIS AOD is routinely used to track transboundary haze from wildfires or dust storms across regions, supplementing ground air quality networks.
	26.	Land Surface Albedo Mapping – Derives the surface albedo (the fraction of sunlight reflected by the surface) using multi-angular or broad-band satellite observations (e.g., MODIS albedo product). Albedo is an important parameter in climate modeling, as different surfaces (snow, forest, desert, urban) reflect different amounts of energy. This function creates albedo maps that help scientists understand energy budgets; for instance, monitoring albedo changes in the Arctic as reflective ice is replaced by darker open water. It also helps in studies of urban climates (cities tend to have lower albedo) and land degradation (bright vs. dark soil surfaces).
	27.	Urban Morphology Classification (Local Climate Zones) – Categorizes urban areas into standardized zone types (like “compact high-rise,” “open low-rise,” “heavy industry,” etc.) using a combination of satellite data and GIS. High-resolution imagery and elevation data (for building heights) are used to classify city landscapes into Local Climate Zones (LCZs), which is useful for urban climate studies. This function helps relate satellite-observed urban structure to thermal profiles (e.g., mapping urban heat island intensity by LCZ) ￼ ￼ and provides consistent inputs for city planning and climate modeling.
	28.	Optical Image Correlation (Feature Tracking) – Measures ground displacements by correlating repeat high-resolution optical images. This technique can detect horizontal shifts on the Earth’s surface between two dates – for example, movement of a landslide, the offset of faults after an earthquake, or the flow rate of glaciers. Sub-pixel correlation of SPOT or Pléiades images, for instance, has been used to map earthquake rupture displacements of a few meters over large areas. In glaciology, optical feature tracking using Landsat or Sentinel-2 enables estimation of glacier velocity by tracking the motion of surface features (like crevasses) between images.
	29.	Glacier Velocity Measurement – Determines the speed at which glaciers or ice streams are flowing by using either optical feature tracking (as above) or SAR interferometry (InSAR) techniques. Missions like TerraSAR-X or Sentinel-1 (with speckle tracking) and optical missions like Landsat have been used to produce glacier velocity maps. This function is critical in cryospheric research to monitor how fast ice is moving toward the ocean. Changes in glacier velocity can indicate evolving conditions at the glacier bed or the influence of climate (e.g., surges or slowdowns). Such measurements feed into estimates of ice discharge contributing to sea level rise.
	30.	Greenhouse Gas Monitoring (CO₂ & CH₄) – Involves satellites designed to measure atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. For example, NASA’s OCO-2 and OCO-3 focus on carbon dioxide, while ESA’s Sentinel-5P and some commercial missions (GHGSat) measure methane. This function produces maps of GHG column concentrations, identifying hotspots of emissions. It has been used to detect major CO₂ sources like power plants and CH₄ leaks from oil/gas operations. These data improve our understanding of carbon sources and sinks and are increasingly used to verify emissions reductions. (One recent application is detecting large methane plumes from space to hold emitters accountable.)
	31.	Volcanic Ash and Gas Tracking – Uses satellite data to detect volcanic ash clouds and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) gas from eruptions. Instruments like the NOAA GOES weather satellites (geostationary) can monitor ash plumes in near real-time, and satellites like TOMS (historic) or Sentinel-5P detect SO₂. This function is crucial for aviation safety – identifying ash cloud extent and movement to reroute aircraft – and for eruption response. It can also track volcanic SO₂ spreading which impacts air quality. For instance, during major eruptions, satellites mapped ash distribution across continents (as with the 2011 Puyehue-Cordón Caulle eruption in Chile) to warn aviation authorities globally.
	32.	Permafrost Change Monitoring – Employs satellite observations (optical, thermal, and radar) to monitor high-latitude permafrost regions for signs of thaw. It may involve tracking the expansion of thermokarst lakes on imagery, measuring ground subsidence with InSAR in tundra areas, or monitoring surface temperature trends. As climate warms, permafrost thaws and can lead to terrain collapse or methane release. Satellite data help map vulnerable zones and changes over vast, remote Arctic areas, informing climate impact models and infrastructure planning (since thawing ground can damage roads and pipelines).
	33.	Multispectral Geological Mapping (ASTER) – ASTER on Terra (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) has multiple bands in SWIR and thermal useful for geology. This function uses band ratios and spectral indices (like iron oxide index, clay mineral index) to differentiate rock types and alteration zones. It has been widely applied in mineral exploration to identify potential ore deposits (e.g., mapping hydrothermal alteration halos in arid regions). By analyzing ASTER’s 14 bands, geologists can produce pseudo-geologic maps highlighting silica, carbonate, or iron-bearing minerals which might not be obvious in true-color imagery.
	34.	Historical Imagery Change Analysis – Integrates declassified or archival imagery (e.g., 1960s CORONA spy satellite photos, historical aerial photos, or early Landsat) with modern data to extend analyses back in time. This function allows researchers to study changes over longer periods than the lifespan of current satellites. For example, comparing CORONA images of the 1960s with today’s images has revealed long-term river channel shifts, historical glacier extents, and archaeological sites. It’s a powerful way to reconstruct past landscapes (such as forest cover before significant human clearing) and assess trends over 50+ years, thereby putting recent changes in context.
	35.	Dust Storm and Aerosol Event Monitoring – Uses satellite imagery and aerosol data to track large dust storms (e.g., Saharan dust outbreaks) and smoke plumes from wildfires. True-color MODIS images can visualize the extent of dust spreading over oceans, and quantitative aerosol optical depth data (from MODIS or VIIRS) show the concentration of particulates. This function enables monitoring of transboundary air pollution events – for instance, African dust traveling to the Caribbean, or wildfire smoke traveling across countries. It informs air quality alerts and helps study the climatic effect of aerosols (since dust can affect cloud formation and solar radiation).

Each of these functions represents a commonly used remote sensing analysis in research or practical applications. Together, they cover a broad spectrum – from land, water, and vegetation monitoring to atmospheric and urban analysis – demonstrating the versatility of satellite imagery in solving real-world problems.
